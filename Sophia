##Loading libraries

## Combining Datasets

### Read CSV Files

```{r cars}
forest_km <- read_delim("forest_area_km.csv")
forest_percent <- read_delim("forest_area_percent.csv")
global_temp <- read_delim("Global_Temperatures.csv")
```
### Checking first few columns in each csv
```{r}
head(forest_km,5) 
head(forest_percent,5) 
head(global_temp,5)
```
### Cleaning Up CSV Files
#### Convert "Country Name" header to "country"
```{r}
forest_km <- forest_km %>%
  rename(country = `Country Name`)
  head(forest_km, 5)
```
#### Convert "Country Name" header to "country"
```{r}
forest_percent <- forest_percent %>%
  rename(country = `Country Name`)
  head(forest_km, 5)
```
#### Convert "year" data type from double to char
```{r}
global_temp <- global_temp %>%
  mutate(year = as.character(year))
```

### Convert Forms from wide to long form

```{r}
countryList <- c('country', 'Country Code')

longForestKM <- forest_km %>%
   pivot_longer(!countryList, names_to = "year", values_to = "km")
longForestKM

```
```{r}

longForestPercent <- forest_percent %>%
   pivot_longer(!countryList, names_to = "year", values_to = "percent")
longForestPercent
```
### Joining Table Together for Forest
```{r}
forest_km_percent <- left_join(longForestKM, longForestPercent)
forest_km_percent
```
### Joining global temp together to create a final set
```{r}
final_set <- left_join(global_temp, forest_km_percent)
final_set
```

```{r}
# location VS forest cover
final_set %>% 
  select(region, year, km) %>% 
  group_by(region) %>% 
  summarize(mean_km = mean(km, na.rm = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(region, mean_km, fill = region)) +
  labs(x = "Region", y = "Average Forest Cover (km)",
       title = "How Different Regions Affect The Tendency of Forests Cover in 1995 to 2020") +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, size = 7.5, hjust = 1))
```

### Data
By selecting only columns of **region, year, km** to narrow down the data we focus on for this specific research question: "Does geographical location affect the tendency of forests to grow or decline?". As the main goal here is find tendency from time period of 1995 to 2020 instead of focusing on each year's tendency, we use summarize method to find the mean of km during this time period.
### result/analysis
By using histogram method of visualization, the graph has showed that North America have highest average forest cover, while Middle East has the lowest average forest cover.
